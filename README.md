### Hi there 👋
My name is Tobiáš and I'm a 19yo software developer with a passion for building and coming up with solutions to complex problems. I'm currently studying at the Secondary Technical School of Electronical Engineering Ječná, Prague

💻 Tech Stack

    > I'm currently getting familiar with PHP and really enjoying the process
    > Python: I love the simplicity and versatility of Python and have used it in a couple of my personal projects
    > MySQL (also have experience with OracleDB and SQL Server, but I just find MySQL to be the most user-friendly)

🔭 What I'm currently working on: At the moment, I am working on my final project for my final year of secondary school (ez-db database manager)
